# Project documentation
Welcome to the UglyFeed project documentation section. This guide provides detailed information for the scripts used by the project.

## Quick start
**UglyFeed now can be used via Docker, please check the updated [documentation](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed/blob/main/docs/docker.md).**

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed.git
    cd UglyFeed
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### Configuration

1. Setup options by making your changes into the `config.yaml` file

**Similarity options**
For a general use the default values seems to be a good fit to aggressively filter out some noise. To increase items count try to reduce min_samples to 2 and play around eps and similarity.

- `similarity_threshold` (range: 0-1)
- `min_samples` (Minimum number of samples in a cluster for DBSCAN)
- `eps` (Maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other in DBSCAN)

**API and LLM options**
You can use OpenAI API or Ollama API, not togheter at the same time. Please comment or delete the unused API to avoid issues.

- `openai_api_url` (OpenAI API endpoint)
- `openai_api_key` (OpenAI API key) [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- `openai_model` (OpenAI model)
- `groq_api_url` (Groq API endpoint)
- `groq_api_key` (Groq API key)
- `groq_model` (Groq model) [Groq models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
- `ollama_api_url` (Ollama API endpoint)
- `ollama_model` (Ollama model) [Ollama models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)

**Instructions/role/prompt option**
- `content_prefix` (prompt to be used as instruction for the rewriting process)

**RSS retention options**
- `max_items` (Maximum number of items to process for the rewriting process)
- `max_age_days` (Maximum age of items in days to be considered)



2. Modify the `input/feeds.txt` file with your feeds urls

### Usage

1. Retrieve and aggregate RSS feeds
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
    
2. Rewrite and save aggregated feeds using configured LLM API:

    ```sh
    python llm_processor.py
    ```
    
3. Convert JSON to RSS feed
    ```sh
    python json2rss.py
    ```
    
4. Serve RSS XML via HTTP server
    ```sh
    python serve.py
    ```

## Project Structure

Main components:

- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration options for the application
- `main.py`: Retrieves and aggregates RSS feeds.
  - `json_manager.py`: Used by main.py, manages JSON file operations. 
  - `rss_reader.py`: Used by main.py, reads RSS feeds.
  - `similarity_checker.py`: Used by main.py, checks similarity between feeds.
- `llm_processor.py`: Rewrites aggregated feeds using a language model LLM APIs.
- `json2rss.py`: Convert JSON to RSS feed.
- `serve.py`: Serve RSS XML via HTTP server.
  - `uglyfeeds`: Used by serve.py is the directory where the uglyfeed.xml is served via HTTP

Optional components:

- `process_multiple_metrics.py`: Evaluate metrics of generated content.
- `evaluate_against_reference.py`: Evaluate metrics of generated content against reference content.

Directories:

- `input`: Directory for feeds list file
- `output`: Directory for aggregated (for similarity) feeds.
- `rewritten`: Directory for rewritten content and evaluation metrics.
- `reports`: Directory for metrics export in JSON and HTML

## Scripts documentation
Each script's documentation includes the following sections:

- **Introduction**
A brief introduction to the script, explaining its purpose and the specific problem it aims to solve.

- **Input/Output**
Information about the expected input formats and the structure of the output data, ensuring users understand what the script requires and what it produces.

- **Functionality**
A deep dive into the core functionality of the script, describing key functions and modules, and how they work together.

- **Code Structure**
An overview of the script's architecture, highlighting major components and their interactions, to give users a clear understanding of how the script is built.

## Additional documentation
### Tuning

**Tune it for your own needs**
- üéõÔ∏è Customize user prompt, check the [prompts](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed/tree/main/prompts) folder for inspiration. You can also check the [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)
- üéõÔ∏è Force specific languages to use for generation just by using specific prompts
- üìà Evaluate generated content against several [metrics](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed/blob/main/docs/metrics.md) (an aggregated score is provided too) by running `python evaluate_against_reference.py` to evaluate comparison metrics of generated files against the reference files or `python process_multiple_metrics.py` to evaluate only the generated content files against different metrics
- üïí Setup a cronjob to have fresh content automatically updated on your RSS reader by executing all files in the order specified

**Tune it by using 3rd party tools**
- üîÅ Create RSS from any content by using [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub) and rewrite its feeds by using [UglyFeed](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed)
- üéõÔ∏è Customize system prompt [by using OpenWebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) on top of Ollama or [by using Ollama itself](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md)
- üåé You can reach your local generated feed securely via Internet by using solutions like ngrok, cloudflared, wireguard, tailscale and so on
