You can use RSSHub to create RSS from any kind of source, examples:

Here are examples of how to create feeds from various sources using RSSHub:

### 1. YouTube Channel
To create a feed from a YouTube channel, use the following path:
```
/youtube/channel/:id
```
**Example:**
```
/youtube/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw
```
This creates an RSS feed for the YouTube channel with the ID `UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw`.

### 2. YouTube Playlist
To create a feed from a YouTube playlist, use the following path:
```
/youtube/playlist/:id
```
**Example:**
```
/youtube/playlist/PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU
```
This creates an RSS feed for the YouTube playlist with the ID `PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU`.

### 3. YouTube Search Keywords
To create a feed from YouTube search keywords, use the following path:
```
/youtube/search/:keywords
```
**Example:**
```
/youtube/search/Linux+server+setup
```
This creates an RSS feed for YouTube search results with the keywords `Linux server setup`.

### 4. WordPress Website
To create a feed from a WordPress website, use the following path:
```
/wordpress/:domain
```
**Example:**
```
/wordpress/example.com
```
This creates an RSS feed for the WordPress website at `example.com`.

### 5. Non-WordPress Website
For non-WordPress websites, you can use a generic RSSHub route if supported, or you might need to create a custom parser.

For example, to create a feed from a generic website, you can use:
```
/webpage/:url
```
**Example:**
```
/webpage/https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
```
This creates an RSS feed for the website at `https://example.com`.

### 6. arXiv Papers
To create a feed from arXiv papers, use the following path:
```
/arxiv/:query
```
**Example:**
```
/arxiv/cs.LG
```
This creates an RSS feed for arXiv papers in the `cs.LG` (Machine Learning) category.

### Example URLs
To access these feeds, you would typically prepend your RSSHub server URL to these paths. For example, if your RSSHub server is hosted at `https://rsshub.example.com`, the full URL for the YouTube channel example would be:
```
https://rsshub.example.com/youtube/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw
```

You can customize these examples based on your specific needs and the IDs or keywords relevant to your interests.
